// Cross-platform positioned I/O and reserved virtual memory.
//
// Two primitive families the expert streamer is built on:
//
//   * Positioned reads with optional cache bypass (O_DIRECT on POSIX,
//     FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING on Windows). Reads are done on aligned windows into an
//     aligned bounce buffer; the caller memcpy's the valid interior out.
//
//   * Reserve/commit/evict/release of virtual address ranges. The LRU expert cache
//     reserves a full-size address range per (layer, projection) but commits physical
//     pages only for the expert slices actually cached, and hands them back on
//     eviction — so a huge reserved span costs RAM only for resident experts.
//
// POSIX commits lazily (commit is a no-op, MADV_DONTNEED reclaims); Windows commits and
// decommits explicitly; Darwin pairs MADV_FREE_REUSABLE on evict with MADV_FREE_REUSE on
// commit, because only that pairing moves phys_footprint — the accounting jetsam enforces
// on iOS. All honour a page-granularity that the caller rounds to.
